# WellLightBerryBush (WLBB)
The goal of WLBB is to locate LEDs in a 3D environement to allow users to create «easely» animations (a maths simulation for example).
Locating the LEDs would be done by smartly using cameras.
This project is designed around modularity, using one server and multiple clients with specific type (one type for remotes, anotherone to control the LEDs, a type to control cameras and a one to process the data). I really want anyone with a bit of knowledge to use this project with stuff they already probably own (like old webcams).

## What about pyWLBB
pyWLBB will be an implementation in python as a module. It will allow to start a python WLBB server pretty easely and perhaps make running clients and server on the same machine easier.
